The common folder is used to store components that are shared across multiple modules and are fundamental to the application's structure. This can include:

Decorators: Custom decorators for routes, parameters, or other features.
Filters: Global or specific filters for handling exceptions and errors.
Guards: Authorization guards to protect routes based on roles or permissions.
Interceptors: Interceptors for logging, transformation, or other middleware-like tasks.
Pipes: Pipes for transforming or validating incoming data.
